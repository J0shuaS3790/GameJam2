# GameJam2

Story starts with protag hearing an alarm
Main character gets out of bed, screen still black 
Main character feels their way around the room
Main character goes to the bathroom, explaining that they are blind in their inner monologue
Bathroom has a white light on the centre top of the screen

Main character presented with 2 options:
Go and listen to the news or make breakfast

News option: Protagonist goes and sits on their armchair and their dog hops up onto their lap. They hear about how a meteor has landed in a nearby forest, and the government suspects aliens before turning it off, dismissing it as hogwash

Breakfast option: Protagonist gets their grub on, feeling their way across the counter and to the fridge, grabbing a box of cereal of the top and milk from in the fridge shelf. While making breakfast they hear murmurings outside of neighbours talking about aliens and being afraid, advising staying at home. Dog barks at them asking for its breakfast, and dog is fed

Both options link back to the main story event, Protag showers and dresses before leaving home with their walking stick and guide dog. 

All outside zones have the warm orange glow of the sun in the central top of the screen at this point.
Protag presented with 3 options:

Take dog to park
Take dog to lake
take dog to town

park path: protag visits the park noticing the absence of the usual bird sounds, the lack of children playing and their dog's unusual calmness
lake path: protag visits the lake and tosses bread to the ducks, waiting for a response. They hear no ducks swimming through the water and no squabble over the scraps of bread they threw. Their dog whimpers but the protag is unsure why.
town path: protag walks into the city with their usually defensive dog being silent the whole time. There are no cars on the road and no horns honking at them when they cross, and the absence of footsteps in the usually bustling city is unsettling.

All options lead to the next sequence, where a government vehicle drives past with blaring sounds, telling anyone nearby to evacuate or take shelter at home over a megaphone speaker in the distance, warning of a sudden alien threat. protag isn't superstitious but their heart skips a beat in that moment, and their dog begins to squirm with a whimper. protag comforts dog before going to head home. On the way home there is a deafening bang, scaring the guide dog and prompting it to run away, ripping its leash handle from their hand, leaving the protag stranded and unsure of where home is.

Turn around and head back the way you came
Keep going forward and call out for your dog
Try to find your way home by yourself

turn back path: protag walks until they find themselves off the path entirely, instead walking on soft mushy grass, hearing the swish of wind in nearby trees



keep going path: protag keeps walking, calling their dogs name until they eventually bump into the porch of someone's house. They use their stick to feel the way up the steps, before making their way to the door and knocking. The inhabitants call them crazy and insult them for not watching the news, telling them to shove off. protag pleads, and asks them to look out for their dog, but they hold steady and reject their entry.



find home path: protag wanders around trying to use their memory as a map to find their house. They eventually end up a few doors down from their own home, only to hear their dog's bark on the other side of the road, heading over to reach him, only to hear him scamper off the path in the other direction.

Addendum: I think it would be cool if the game ran on a relatively short loop where the player has to collect and investigate different things on the journey to the ending, perhaps as the player is sucked into whatever the light is accidentally and is forced to repeat the day canonically. This allows for a lot of content to be made via slight alterations with each repeat, with things growing more drastic and confusing and more puzzles popping up.
