VRRRRM-VRRRRRRRRRRRM-VRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRM

An ever irritating alarm brings me back to the world of the living. 

VRRRRRRRRRRRRRMMMMMMM-VRMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM-Click.

I silence my alarm, getting out of bed and stretching with a yawn. I rub my eyes, before slipping out of bed and into my sliders, shuffling my way across the floor. I feel my way along my bedroom wall in the darkness, making my way to the bathroom. It appears dream me had been guzzling water, as I desperately needed to pee the moment I woke up. I make my way out of my room to the toilet, flicking the light switch on.

NEW CG ADDED HERE, WHITE LIGHT 

 I don't even know why I bothered. It's still dark. It always has been. I shuffle my way over to the toilet, taking my place atop my porcelain throne.

 I am blind. I went blind seven years ago, due to genetic defects that run throughout my family. Now I'm here. Living my daily life as usual, with a bit of help from my neighbours and my beloved dog pipin.
