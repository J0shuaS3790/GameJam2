An ever irritating alarm brings me back to the world of the living. 
VRRRRRRRRRRRRRMMMMMMM-VRMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM-Click.
[[Wake up]] 

&lt;/body&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Tune into the news" tags="" position="175,450" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;I head over to my sofa, feeling for the back edge and moving around to the front, flopping down as Pipin hops up next to me. I reach between the cushions where the remote always seems to be, and turn the TV on with a click. 
&quot;The weather today will be clear and sunny today, with precipitation later into the night.&quot; Pipin lets out a happy bark as if he understood that this means that it&#39;s prime time for a long walk.
The news plays for an extra twenty or so minutes, with a variety of mundane topics being brought up as per usual. I&#39;m about to turn it off and get ready to leave before something catches my attention.
&quot;An unidentified object has been sighted in the skies of XXXXX-ville recently, with scientists speculating it to be a new type of meteor. Could this be our first sighting of Alie-&quot; Click.
I turn the TV off just as the reporter lady gets into the Aliens rant. I&#39;ve never been interested in superstition.
My mother was a bit of a fanatic, believing in the occult and acting like it was the be-all end-all for most of my childhood. For me, it just ticks me off. How do people put their faith in this drivel?
I get up from the couch, with a few pats for Pipin&#39;s fluffy little head.



[[What&#39;s Next]] 

&lt;/body&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Make breakfast" tags="" position="425,450" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;I head over to my kitchen and hear Pipin&#39;s excited paw-steps as he wakes up from his bed in the living room. He gives me a bark to let me know where he&#39;s at and I pat him on the head for being the goodest boy.
I hear his feet pitter patter over to the fridge, and I feel for the fridge to open it before feeling around for the long, thin bacon package I keep in the back.
I grab the package, find my way to the air fryer I keep near the sink and fumble for the baking paper I keep next to it, spreading it about and tossing the bacon in. I toss the scraps to Pipin, which I hear him wolf down gleefully.
I pour out some beans into a pan I grabbed from a cupboard and leave it on a simmer, and in just a few minutes I have a delicious breakfast ready for the eating. The birds chirp along as I let my food cool and plate it, greeting the morning with the same vigour Pipin was.
I scarf it down giving Pipin the leftovers and continue with my day. 


[[What&#39;s Next]] 

&lt;/body&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="What&#39;s Next" tags="" position="300,575" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;After starting the day off strong, I head off to shower before picking out my favourite clothes that I recognise by the silky cloth texture, checking for the feeling of the tag to make sure they&#39;re not back to front or inside out.
Dressed and ready for the day, I head over to the front door, grabbing my white cane from a rack I remember to be left of the door.
Pipin, ever loyal brings me my hoop keychain from wherever it was sat beforehand. I hear the jingle and grab it from his mouth, before petting him again as a sign of thanks.
I fumble with my keys and realise that I&#39;ve forgotten which key unlocks my door...



[[Which key did I need...]] 

&lt;/body&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Which key did I need..." tags="" position="300,725" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;I feel the keys one by one, checking their shapes and sizes as I do so. There are 5 keys, all of various models and makes. 
There&#39;s a triangle headed key
A round headed key
A square headed key
A looped key, with a larger rounded head split into three joint circles
And a rusty key, one the landlord gave me for the backyard shed, If I recall.

I remember the front door key has more than one edge, no sharp corners and a smooth feeling when sat in your hand... Now which key was it?

[[Rusty Key]]   [[Square Key]]   [[Triangle Key]]   [[Looped Key]]   [[Circle Key]] 

&lt;/body&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Rusty Key" tags="" position="25,550" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;I push the key into the lock confidently, turning it to unlock the door... But it doesn&#39;t turn. The key clinks in the keyhole, stopping in place entirely.
I feel a bit embarrassed, and though I can&#39;t see him I can feel Pipin&#39;s disappointed gaze on my skin.

[[Which key did I need...]] &lt;/body&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Looped Key" tags="" position="300,875" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;I push the key into the lock confidently, turning it to unlock the door... The keyhole turns with a click, and I hear the lock disengage, pulling the door handle and feeling the fresh morning breeze on my skin.
Pipin goes and grabs his leash, I put it around his neck, and we head out into the day.

[[Head outside]] 

&lt;/body&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Circle Key" tags="" position="25,675" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;I push the key into the lock confidently, turning it to unlock the door... But it doesn&#39;t turn. The key clinks in the keyhole, stopping in place entirely.

I step outside and lock the door behind me, feeling Pipin tug at his leash excited to go on his walk. It&#39;s oddly quiet today, but the feeling of a warm breeze and the sun on my skin is revitalising nonetheless. As I walk though, I start to notice that it&#39;s almost //too quiet.// The birds aren&#39;t chirping, the bugs aren&#39;t buzzing, the cars aren&#39;t revving down the roads... Pipin seems happy, but I start to wonder if something happened to keep people in around here. Just as I stop to ponder, I realise the leash isn&#39;t being tugged at anymore. I go to reach for Pipin- but he&#39;s not there, nothing is! Just as panic sets in, a flash of white overwhelms me, soaking my entire being. My fears are washed away, my mind left blank, occupied by only a silent glow. I feel myself cease to be...

[[Disappear]] 

&lt;/body&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Wake up" tags="" position="450,25" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;I silence my alarm, getting out of bed and stretching with a yawn. I rub my eyes, before slipping out of bed and into my sliders, shuffling my way across the floor. I feel my way along my bedroom wall in the darkness, making my way to the bathroom. It appears dream me had been guzzling water, as I desperately needed to pee the moment I woke up. 




[[Go to the bathroom]] 

&lt;/body&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Go to the bathroom" tags="" position="450,175" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;
I make my way out of my room to the toilet, flicking the light switch on.
I don&#39;t even know why I bothered. It&#39;s still dark. It always has been. I shuffle my way over to the toilet, taking my place atop my porcelain throne.

[[While I&#39;m here...]] 

&lt;/body&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="While I&#39;m here..." tags="" position="300,175" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;
I am blind. I went blind seven years ago, due to genetic defects that run throughout my family. Now I&#39;m here. Living my daily life as usual, with a bit of help from my neighbours and my beloved dog pipin. It&#39;s not easy living alone without your sight, but I don&#39;t really have anyone who can live with me to help out, and god knows the higher ups aren&#39;t looking to. Pipin has done me good thus far, and I have more faith in him than any person could hope for.

[[Finish up in the bathroom]] 

&lt;/body&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Finish up in the bathroom" tags="" position="300,325" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;
But my ranting aside, I should really get set on the first order of the morning... I need to take a shower, but for right now that can wait. My stomach grumbles at me, just as discontented to be awake as I am apparently. I consider making myself something to eat to start my day, or I could check the news before heading out. Pipin loves his morning walks, and I don&#39;t want to get caught in a sudden rainstorm...

[[Tune into the news]]    [[Make breakfast]]

&lt;/body&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="wake up" tags="" position="1000,50" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;
My eyes snap open, my heart racing and tears on the edge of my eyes. The panic I felt mere moments ago rushes back in full force, making me very awake. As the light I saw just now fades from my eyes, I&#39;m greeted by the ever somber darkness I am so used to. My head is pounding, and I desperately need to use the bathroom.

[[go to the bathroom]] 


&lt;/body&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="go to the bathroom" tags="" position="1000,200" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;
I make my way out of my room to the toilet, flicking the light switch on.
A weird glow seems to emanate from the room, and though I can&#39;t //see// it, something deep within me can sense the white lightbulb hanging above me. 

[[what just happened...?]] 

&lt;/body&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="&lt;-- LED LIGHT TOP MIDDLE OF SCREEN" tags="" position="575,175" size="100,100">
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="what just happened...?" tags="" position="850,200" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;
As my heart rate stabilises, I think through what just happened... A dream? Deja vu? It felt so real, yet here I am, back in my house. My dreams have always been vivid, even without sight my imagination has long been a force to be reckoned with. This though? This was crazy... Regardless, I need to get on with my day.

I take a brisk shower to wash away the confusion and thoughts I&#39;d been mulling over, and just decide to get on with it. I quickly dress myself in my favourite clothes and walk out into the living room. My stomach grumbles, commanding a meal, but now I&#39;m even more curious as to what&#39;s on the news...

[[tune into the news]]    [[make breakfast]]


&lt;/body&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="tune into the news" tags="" position="750,450" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;
I shuffle my way over to my sofa, sitting down on it as Pipin wakes up from his sleep. He happily patters his way over to me before sitting on my lap, as this time I let the TV play for more info.

&quot;An unidentified object has been sighted in the skies of XXXXX-ville recently, with scientists speculating it to be a new type of meteor. Could this be our first sighting of Aliens? The meteor is on a crash course for our humble planet, but is predicted to cause very little harm due to its small size and unusually slow velocity. Stay tuned for updates as meteorologists monitor the object&#39;s location.&quot; 

What followed was mostly unimportant local news, so I turned the TV off with my newly gained knowledge and heading for the door.

[[Keys...]] 


&lt;/body&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="make breakfast" tags="" position="975,450" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;
I hear Pipin stir from his bed across the room as I make my way over to the kitchen to make something to eat. I throw something quick and easy together, not looking to strain myself after my rough awakening, and feel for the kibble bag I keep tucked beneath my kitchen sink. I feed Pipin and refill his water bowl as I notice the absence of birdsong from my kitchen window... 
I finish eating and decide to head outside to clear my head.

[[Keys...]] 


&lt;/body&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="Keys..." tags="" position="850,575" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;
Pipin brings me my keys and his collar, knowing that it&#39;s time to go on a walk, and I check the keychain for the key that unlocks my front door... I remember the keyhead has more than one edge, no sharp corners and a smooth feeling when sat in my hand, so I feel around for which key is which. I notice a Rusty key, a Circle key, a Square one and a Triangle one.

[[rusty key]]    [[circle key]]    [[square key]]    [[triangle key]] 


&lt;/body&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="rusty key" tags="" position="675,700" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;I push the key into the lock confidently, turning it to unlock the door... But it doesn&#39;t turn. The key clinks in the keyhole, stopping in place entirely.

&lt;&lt;if $answer is &quot;open Door&quot;&gt;&gt;

I pull on the handle of my front door, and it opens. It opens as if it were never locked to begin with. That can&#39;t be true, I think to myself; I always lock my door habitually, my mother drilled it into me since I was young... And Pipin always barks even if I do forget. A chill runs down my spine, but as far as I&#39;m aware there&#39;s no one in my home, and Pipin would have them for breakfast if there were. He&#39;s a big brave dog, and he&#39;s my best friend because of it. I decide to shrug it off though, as there&#39;s no use in standing here thinking about it. I lock the door behind me and step out into the daylight.
[[To the streets]]

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
What do I do?...
[[...Huh?]] 

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="To the streets" tags="" position="525,1150" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;
I head out into town with Pipin, taking in the fresh air and the... strange absence of noise. The wind blows, the gravel cracks but the bugs aren&#39;t buzzing, the birds aren&#39;t chirping and the buzz of society seems to have quieted... I get a wave of Deja Vu from my dream last night, and my headache returns pervasive as ever. I don&#39;t let it get me down though, feeling the sun on my skin and being out here with my best friend is all I could really ask for.
I take a &#39;&#39;left&#39;&#39;, a &#39;&#39;right&#39;&#39; and another &#39;&#39;left&#39;&#39; and arrive at the town centre, I can tell by the difference in texture of the path beneath my feet. Smooth concrete bricks pathe the roads here rather than the gravelly pavement I&#39;m so used to. Pipin seems happy to be here but it&#39;s awfully quiet, so I decide to take him elsewhere.

I take a &#39;&#39;right&#39;&#39; from the middle of town, before taking another &#39;&#39;right&#39;&#39; and a &#39;&#39;left&#39;&#39; on the edge of town to arrive at the park. It&#39;s peaceful here, the soft rustling of the leaves in the trees comforts my soul, and Pipin seems to feel the same way. For a brief moment, I forget everything that has happened thus far. I am calm... Until I feel a sudden tug on the leash I&#39;m holding, followed by a short &#39;yip&#39;. Panic sets in once more, as I call for Pipin, realising the leash is on the ground, completely detached from him. He&#39;s a good boy, and if something spooked him and he got lost, I know he&#39;d go straight home as he&#39;d always been taught... The issue is, how do I find my way back without him... I call out for Pipin, trying to retrace the steps I&#39;ve took this far as I do so, being unable to see forcing me to rely on approximations and memory of the journey. I stress my mind to think of how I got here... Now which way was home?...

I take a &quot;left&quot; from the middle of town, followed by a &quot;right.&quot; At the end of the road I turn &quot;left,&quot; and then &quot;left&quot; again at the next corner. As we make it to the lake, I feel the excited pitter patter of Pipin&#39;s paws, the smell of an open body of water hitting my nostrils and filling me with nostalgia. Since the loss of my sight, other sensory inputs have become a lot more meaningful to me... Something as little as a familiar smell or taste can put me at ease, as I tend to seek comfort in the things I can recognise without needing to see them first. My moment of tranquillity was quickly disturbed though, as I felt a sudden tug at the leash, followed by a short &#39;yip&#39;. Panic sets in once more, as I call for Pipin, realising the leash is on the ground, completely detached from him.

Just as the last light of hope fades from my soul, I hear a deafening crash, and blinding light consumes my vision...

My soul feels rejuvenated in the moment, and I passionately call out for Pipin once more. I hear his pitter patter running in my direction, and I excitedly start to run towards it, forgetting myself for a second. In that instant, a flash of white consumes me, and just as Pipin jumps into my arms, I find myself washed away in a wave of light.

An ever irritating alarm brings me back to the world of the living. 
VRRRRRRRRRRRRRMMMMMMM-VRMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM-Click.
[[Get up.]]
&lt;/body&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="57" name="Get up." tags="" position="1500,175" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;I get out of bed. My head spins. I feel nauseous. I rush to the bathroom, tripping over myself as I crawl along the walls in a hurry. After relieving myself from both ends. I take a moment to collect myself, clasping my face in my hands. I don&#39;t know if this is some cyclic dream, or if some devil has chosen to torment me today, but something is seriously wrong. My thoughts swirl violently, giving me no moment of respite. My skin crawls, the sinister feeling reaching deep into my bones. 
[[Collect yourself.]]
&lt;/body&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="58" name="Collect yourself." tags="" position="1500,300" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;I gather my thoughts, stepping out into my living room. I feel too sick to eat breakfast this morning, and the dread I feel at the idea of turning the news on today compels me not to. I don&#39;t bother showering or dressing... For all I know this is just another cycle of a dream. I call for Pipin to bring me my keys, promising him a walk. He brings me the keychain that holds my keys, but I hear no jingle. I feel for the keys, looking to figure out which I&#39;ll need this time... But the keychain is empty. A simple, circle band. My mind is overcome with terror, the inevitability of what was about to happen scaring me to my core. I reach for the door handle, only to find it isn&#39;t there. My door is not there.
[[Step out.]]
&lt;/body&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="59" name="Step out." tags="" position="1500,425" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;I walk out into the sunlight, and the daylight hurts my eyes. The sun is blindingly bright today, and though the sky is clear and blue and the town looks as idyllic as ever, I am unsettled to my core. Pipin walks out with me, and I pat him on the head as we walk out into town.
[[Proceed.]]
&lt;/body&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="60" name="Proceed." tags="" position="1500,550" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;I walk into town, averting my gaze from the tall glass monolith buildings doing their very best to reflect the sun into my eyes. I look down at Pipin, making sure he&#39;s ok, and he shoots me a look of anxiety far too human for my liking. He gazes past me, up into the skies above, and I follow his gaze to see the sky turning an unusually pale shade of white. An infectious glow melts the sky and the clouds together, forming a pure white sheet that seems to cover the world we live in. Before I have time to think on it, a thunderous crash echoes through the town, back in the direction that we came from.
[[Return.]]
&lt;/body&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="61" name="Return." tags="" position="1500,675" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;As I get closer to my home, I notice a pale glow coming from an opening in the woods not far from where I live. I instinctively turn to get a better look, and before I know it my legs have started moving me towards it. As I wonder what could be giving off all of that light, if it&#39;s another person, if they are scared and afraid too, if they could help me... I realise... When did I start being able to see again?
[[Avert your eyes no longer.]]
&lt;/body&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="62" name="Avert your eyes no longer." tags="" position="1500,800" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;I find myself being pulled into the forest, Pipin walking ahead of me at an unnatural canter. In any other situation I would be overjoyed to see my beloved companion, a reality I never expected to have within my life, but not like this. I put all of my power into catching up with him, to hold him and tell him to run, but no matter how hard I run he seems to stay just a few feet ahead of me. I try to turn and run the other way, but my body refuses to listen to me when I do. All I can do is simply walk ahead, approaching the light at the end of the tunnel.
[[Approach.]]
&lt;/body&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="63" name="GO FROM DARK SCENE TO PALE GLOW IN CENTRE OF SCREEN --&gt;" tags="" position="1375,800" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="64" name="Approach." tags="" position="1500,925" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;I find myself standing in front of the thing. A writhing, contorted thing. My tired eyes struggle to make out a shape, a form of what lays in front of me. As my legs creak towards it, Pipin sitting a few steps away from it subserviently, I can only think of one thing. Staring deep into the soul of this creature, one thought occupies my mind. An absolute, all powerful, 

&lt;&lt;set $answer to &quot;glow&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;textbox &quot;$answer&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;glow&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="65" name="glow" tags="" position="1500,1050" size="100,100">&lt;body&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $answer is &quot;glow&quot;&gt;&gt;
 My hand reaches out to the thing, and my no longer blind eyes weep a single tear, for me, and for Pipin. As the light begins to wash over me for the final time, I accept that I will be nothing more than an afterglow.
